title: Let the framewars begin!
---

Hey everyone, I'm Nicolas Marcora and this is my friend Brandon Lyons. For a while now, Brandon and I have been bickering about which JavaScript UI Framework/library is better (spoiler alert: it's totally React, but he thinks it's Vue for some odd reason that still escapes me).

One day, not very long ago at all, we realised that in the last couple of years we've both ended up getting comfortable with our respective frameworks, and that merely swinging our frameworks around was not going to get us anywhere, so we've decided to leave our trenches and form a truce.

Long story short, we'll be talking to each other about how Vue and React compare, starting from the very foundations to perhaps building some more advanced, real apps. Along the way, we will also probably be discussing other new and shiny JS tech as well as everything else under the web development sun.

And since we'll be doing all that, we thought we might as well record it and share it with the world, in case anyway's interested. So stay tuned for Framewars!
